There will be two version (see **screenshots**, http://goo.gl/ISi9eW):

1. Light: **_UDL_ZPL_SolarizedLight.xml_**  (updated on May-04-2014)

2. Dark:  **_UDL_ZPL_SolarizedDark.xml_**   (not yet uploaded)

###[HOW TO USE]

The User Defined Language(UDL) style files are for Notepad++ (developed on NPP v6.5, http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), working in conjunction with the two default Solarized themes (Solarized-light and Solarzied), respectively.

1. Launch NPP, depending on which brightness version you want to use, set the overall theme first:

  _[Setting -> Style Configurator -> Select theme -> Solarized-light/Solarized]_

  The font style can also be set in the Style Configurator.

2. Import the UDL style XML file.

  _[Language -> Define your language -> Import]_

3. Restart NPP

4. Open a .ZPL file and the color syntax shoud work automatically. If not, select it manually by

  _[Language -> ZPL_SolarL/ZPL_SolarD]_

5. If you want to change the color or style, go to

  _[Language -> Define your language]_ and make changes.
