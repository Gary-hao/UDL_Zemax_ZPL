[HOW TO USE]

The User Defined Language(UDL) style files are for Notepad++ (developed on v6.5), working in conjunction with the two default Solarized theme (Solarized-light and Solarzied), respectively.

1. Launch NPP, depending on which brightness version you want to use, set the overall theme first:

  _[Setting -> Style Configurator -> Select theme -> Solarized-light/Solarized]_

  The font style can also be set in the Style Configurator.

2. Import the UDL style XML file.

  _[Language -> Define your language -> Import]_

3. Restart NPP

4. Open a .ZPL file and the color syntax shoud work automatically. If not, select it manually by

  _[Language -> ZPL_SolarL/ZPL_SolarD]_

5. If you want to change the color or style, go to

  _[Language -> Define your language]_ and make changes.
